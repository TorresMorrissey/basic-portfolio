    <p> Hello, World! Welcome to my portfolio. As you have noticed my name is Jazmin, I've been on earth for about 25
        years.
        while I'm here I partake in spicy foods, progressive reads, dancing for free, and stretching my body to
        some mantras.
        I've lived and traveld from such places as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Martinez,CA, Arizona, Angel City
        Philippines, Briefly Vancouver, Canada
        and recently moved back to my hometown of Riverside CA. When I'm not doing yoga outdoors, and pushing
        myself just enough to believe I
        am flexable, I'm getting ready and putting together creative/abstract outfits to show the world. You can
        find me at a tiny hole-in-the-wall
        bar, secret shows in random locations, interpersonal venues with my favorite electronic artists. Surley,
        you can't forget the 80's tribute nights and spending time with the LGBTQ comBmunity. However, When I'm not
        ruleing the nightlife you can find me at a local coffee shop, thrift stores, or the great outdoors.
        I believe in loving every moment of your life. That belief stems from great authors, and public speakers.
        With those beliefs I landed in the web-dev world and greatly look forward to learning many other languages
        to help businesses around the world. Since "Everybody wants to rule the world."
