<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<img src="https://preview.ibb.co/cGMJBz/IMG_3068.jpg"> <p> Hello, World! Welcome to my portfolio. As you have noticed my name is Jazmin, I've been on earth for about 25 years. 
while I'm here I partake in spicy foods, progressive reads, dancing for free, and stretching my body to some mantras. 
I've lived and traveld from such places as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Martinez,CA, Arizona, Angel City Philippines, Briefly Vancouver, Canada, 
and recently moved back to my hometown of Riverside CA. When I'm not doing yoga outdoors, and pushing myself just enough to believe I 
am flexable, I'm getting ready and putting together creative/abstract outfits to show the world. You can find me at a tiny hole-in-the-wall 
bar, secret shows in random locations, interpersonal venues with my favorite electronic artists. Surley, you can't forget the 80's tribute nights and spending 
time with the LGBTQ community. However, When I'm not ruleing the nightlife you can find me at a local coffee shop, thrift stores, or the great outdoors. 
I believe in loving every moment of your life. That belief stems from great authors, and public speakers. With those beliefs I landed in the web-dev world and greatly 
look forward to learning many other languages to help businesses around the world. Since "Everybody wants to rule the world."
